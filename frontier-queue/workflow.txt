for datasourcing: 
    - load seed config (get domain and start urls)
        - for each seed url, try the find sitemaps (publisher approved lists of canonical pages)
            - these can exist as a sitemap idnex and urlset (datasource.py will detech which one)
        - canonicalize each url / discovered url to prevent duplicate crawling
